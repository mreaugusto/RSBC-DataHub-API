# HTTP Client

This project uses IntelliJ's HTTP Client to create and send API requests. Used for exploratory and intuitive testing, as well as learning the API to build a test suit.

To use the .http file, you need IntelliJ IDEA's HTTP client plugin installed (free from JetBrains). Open this folder in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Environment configuration

Rename http-client.private.env.json-template to http-client.private.env.json and configure it.
